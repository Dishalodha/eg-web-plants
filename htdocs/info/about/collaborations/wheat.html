<h1>Designing Future Wheat</h1>

<p>The development of resources for wheat is funded by the BBSRC-funded <a href="https://www.jic.ac.uk/research/designing-future-wheat/" rel="external">Designing Future Wheat</a>.</p>

<p>The Designing Future Wheat Institute Strategic Programme (ISP) spans eight research institutes and 
universities and aims to develop new wheat germplasm containing the next generation of key traits.</p>

<p>Ensembl Plants is part of Work package 4 which is responsible for the ‘Data access and analysis’ work 
package, working to advance the data landscape for wheat comparative analysis through new sequencing 
experiments, and the development of an informatics infrastructure to provide a comprehensive federated 
and open data portal.</p>
