<h1>Track hubs for all public RNA-Seq studies in plants</h1>

<p>As part of a BBSRC-funded crop infrastructure project, we have established a pipeline 
for generating track hubs for all public RNA-Seq studies in the INSDC archives. The pipeline 
discovers and aligns reads from RNA-Seq studies across all plant species in Ensembl Plants. 
Alignments and their associated metadata are registered in the Track Hub Registry for search 
and discovery within the genome browser.</p>

<p>In detail, the pipeline uses the ENA's search APIs to discover all plant-spcific RNA-Seq 
studies. The read data for each study is aligned to the appropriate reference genome in 
Ensembl Plants using the <a href="http://nunofonseca.github.io/irap/">iRAP pipeline</a> developed 
by the EMBL-EBI <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/about/people/robert-petryszak">Gene Expression team</a>.
Quality-filtered reads are aligned using <a href="https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/tophat/index.shtml">TopHat 2</a>. The resulting BAM files are converted to 
<a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/software/cram-toolkit">CRAM format</a>. Each set of CRAM files 
for a specific study, along with their associated sample and study metadata, are used to create a 
track hub that is registered in the Track Hub Registry.</p>
