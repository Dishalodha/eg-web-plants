<p>Selected barley cultivars relevant for genomics and breeding will be displayed in Ensembl.</p>

<p>Golden Promise is a 2-row spring type historical variety which was used extensively for 
malting and whisky production. In recent years, the main research interest has come from being
the most efficient genotype for genetic transformation in barley. A contiguous reference assembly 
was produced by integrating Illumina paired-end reads, long mate-pair reads, Dovetail Chicago 
<i>in vitro</i> proximity ligation libraries and chromosome conformation capture sequencing (Hi-C), as described in <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1534/g3.119.40101">http://dx.doi.org/10.1534/g3.119.401010</a>. Tritex gene annotation was generated by association as described in <a href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.9705125.v3">https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.9705125.v3</a>.

<p>TRITEX is actually the reference cultivar Morex with an updated assembly, as described at 
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-019-1899-5">https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-019-1899-5</a>. 
Gene annotation was taken from <a href="https://doi.org/10.5447/ipk/2019/8">https://doi.org/10.5447/ipk/2019/8</a>. For clarity it is shown as a separate strain while the Morex V3 assembly is not 
published.</p>
